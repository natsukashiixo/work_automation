# work_automation
collection of scripts to make work less tedious. mostly here because of frequent computer shifts. very ad hoc.

# requirements

https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/
https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/
https://pypi.org/project/natsort/

note to self: pdf2image requires a Windows Poppler install
natsort for non-windows machines requires additional configuration iirc

most scripts are designed to be placed and run in the same folder as the files they're processing with the exception of imageflipper which expects a subfolder named 'imagestomerge'.
